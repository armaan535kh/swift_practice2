Here are 10 exercises to practice variables, constants, data types, and characters and strings:

    Variables and Constants Basics:
        Create a constant to store your name.
        Create a variable to store your current age.
        Print both the name and age.

    Data Types Conversion:
        Create a variable to store a floating-point number (e.g., 3.14).
        Convert the floating-point number to an integer and store it in another variable.
        Print both the floating-point and integer values.

    String Manipulation:
        Create a string variable to store a sentence.
        Find the length of the string and print it.
        Convert the entire string to uppercase and print it.

    Character Operations:
        Create a variable to store a character.
        Print the Unicode value of the character.
        Check if the character is a letter or a number and print the result.

    Combining Strings:
        Create two string variables to store your first name and last name.
        Combine them to create a full name and print it.
        Add a space between the first name and last name when combining.

    String Interpolation:
        Create variables to store your first name, last name, and age.
        Use string interpolation to create a sentence like "My name is [first name] [last name] and I am [age] years old." and print it.

    Type Inference:
        Declare a variable with an initial value of 10.5 without explicitly specifying its type.
        Declare a constant with an initial value of "Swift" without explicitly specifying its type.
        Print the types of both variables using type(of:).

    Optional Strings:
        Create an optional string variable to store a nickname.
        Assign a value to the optional string and print it using optional binding.
        Assign nil to the optional string and safely unwrap it using the nil-coalescing operator to provide a default value.

    String Indices:
        Create a string variable with the value "Hello, Swift!".
        Extract and print the first and last characters of the string.
        Print the substring from the 8th character to the end of the string.

    Constants and Variables Interaction:
        Create a constant to store the number of days in a week.
        Create a variable to store the number of hours you spend coding each day.
        Calculate and print the total number of hours you spend coding in a week using the constant and variable.
